Subject: [Rtspproxy-devel] Testing
Message-ID: <200905191614.47498.manuel.arguelles@gmail.com>

Hello,

Is there a way to test the rtsp proxy without a mobile device? I'm trying to 
use xine but it seems that I can't set up the proxy information. Is there any 
other client that I can use to test it?

Regards
