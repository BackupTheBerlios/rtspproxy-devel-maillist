Subject: [Rtspproxy-devel] Creating RTSP messages
Message-ID: <OF825FA96C.2B8C3300-ON6525745C.003B195C-6525745C.003B8529@tcs.com>

Hi All!
I am new to using Berlios RTSPProxy.
I don't know if this can be done but, I am trying to use the underlying 
stack in Berlios RTSPProxy to create a simple program 
using which I would be able to send RTSP messages to Darwin streaming 
server using the .

I would really appreciate, if somebody could help me with this.

Thanks and Regards,
Rakesh Sehgal
