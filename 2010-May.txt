Subject: [Rtspproxy-devel] RTSP question for RTPProxy
Message-ID: <AANLkTinrbtfsjhJsSzLGGXgb19LdUFSIRx1VIEtGnPzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I am extremely interested in using this product but I had a few questions on
whether it would meet my requirements. I couldn't quite figure it out from
the project web page so I would really appreciate anybody taking the time
here to help me.

I am interested in taking an RTP stream and wrapping it via RTSP.

For example:
Client A sends RTP to Proxy
Proxy provides RTSP stream for Client B to access

I notice some configuration settings in regards to RTSP but it wasn't clear
whether this was for client or server.

If somebody could let me know whether this is possible that would be great.

Kind regards,
Andy Savage

Hi Andy


Not entirely sure if that is even possible in RTSP ;
for instance who will setup client B to recieve the packets and do
whatever it needs to do

If you want to simpy redirect the RTP/UDP  to another device / machine
then  simply look for the SETUP response in ProxyHandler and make you
changes
